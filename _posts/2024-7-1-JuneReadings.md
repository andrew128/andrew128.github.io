title: June 2024 Summary of Resources 
---

Summary of books I read in June. It would be interesting use at least some of these resources to analyze how today's Generative AI technology may influence the current world order. 
 
## Chip War: The Quest to Dominate the World's Most Critical Technology
A detailed introduction to chips, semiconductors, transistors since the mid half of the 20th century to the present day. 
It showed how chip technology both influenced and was influenced by major historical events starting from the end of the second world war and the start of the Cold War through the space race and up until the present day with the Taiwan/China situation.
A key theme was how so many different people were involved from the start of the conception of the transistor to making it more mainstream to designing it to be mass-produced. 
Both people who designed the chip and people who commercialized the chip through aggressive management and sales tactics were integral to the widespread adoption. 

A good book for anyone wanting to understand the history behind the technology powering the world today as well as be aware of the origins of some of today's geopolitical conflicts. 
I may come back here as I'm interested in analyzing the effect of Generative AI on today's world order.

## Age of Revolutions: Progress and Backlash form 1600 to the Present
Presents a detailed analysis of various revolutions and how the surrounding environment contributed to revolutions. For example, the Dutch Golden Age is covered. There was a period of time when the Dutch were the most advanced civilization in the world in terms of governance, free trade, and technology. The French put a stop to that by invading, causing the Dutch to flood their own land to survive but in the process destroying much of their own livelihood. The English were next. They were the first country to keep a parliment like government. The French and industrial revolutions in each of its phases is also covered.

This is definitely a book I want to come back to and think more analytically about how these revolutions affect today's society. Zakaria does present his own take on this subject.

## The World for Sale: Money, Power, and the Traders Who Barter the Earth's Resources
This book walks through the history of commodity traders and their effects on the world starting from the mid 20th century. An underlying theme is greed and willingness to prioritize profit above all else as seen through the various examples of flouting economic sanctions in places like South Africa during the Apartheid, or Iran in the 60s and 70s. 

I may come back to this area as I'm particularly interested in how these raw materials play a role in the semiconductor industry.
