title: June 2024 Summary of Resources 
---

Summary of books I read in June. It would be interesting use at least some of these resources to analyze how today's Generative AI technology may influence the current world order. 
 
## Chip War: The Quest to Dominate the World's Most Critical Technology
A detailed introduction to chips, semiconductors, transistors since the mid half of the 20th century to the present day. 
It showed how chip technology both influenced and was influenced by major historical events starting from the end of the second world war and the start of the Cold War through the space race and up until the present day with the Taiwan/China situation.
A key theme was how so many different people were involved from the start of the conception of the transistor to making it more mainstream to designing it to be mass-produced. 
Both people who designed the chip and people who commercialized the chip through aggressive management and sales tactics were integral to the widespread adoption. 
A good book for anyone wanting to understand the history behind the technology powering the world today as well as be aware of the origins of some of today's geopolitical conflicts. 

## Age of Revolutions: Progress and Backlash form 1600 to the Present
Presents a detailed analysis of various revolutions and how the surrounding environment contributed to revolutions.
Contains an analysis of the modern day political situation. 

## The World for Sale: Money, Power, and the Traders Who Barter the Earth's Resources
This book walks through the history of commodity traders and their effects on the world starting from the mid 20th century. An underlying theme is a willingness to prioritize profit above all else as seen through the various examples of flouting economic sanctions in places like South Africa during the Apartheid, or Iran in the 60s and 70s.
