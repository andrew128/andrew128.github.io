title: Intro to Neo4j (Graph Databases)
---

A primer on Graph Databases with Neo4j. 

## What are Graph Databases?

Graph databases are specialized database systems designed to store and process data in terms of vertices (nodes) and edges (relationships). Unlike traditional databases, graph databases explicitly store relationships between data points, making them ideal for handling highly connected data.

### Key Use Cases

Graph databases excel in scenarios where relationships between entities are as important as the entities themselves:

- Social networks (friend connections, interactions)
- Fraud detection (identifying suspicious patterns)
- Knowledge graphs (connecting related concepts)
- Recommendation engines (product suggestions)
- Supply chain optimization (logistics networks)

## Comparison with Traditional Databases

### Limitations of SQL Databases

Traditional SQL databases face several challenges when handling graph-like data:

1. **Implicit Relationships**: Connections between data must be established through foreign keys and joins
2. **Performance Issues**: Complex queries requiring multiple joins become increasingly inefficient
3. **Schema Rigidity**: Different types of nodes often require separate tables, leading to a complex schema
4. **Query Complexity**: Graph traversal operations require multiple JOIN operations

### Limitations of NoSQL Databases

Document and key-value stores also struggle with graph data:

1. **Multiple Lookups**: Traversing relationships requires multiple separate queries
2. **Limited Relationship Modeling**: Relationships are not first-class citizens
3. **Complex Graph Operations**: Operations like shortest path algorithms are difficult to implement efficiently

## Neo4j Architecture

### Key Concepts

Neo4j is built from the ground up to handle graph data efficiently through:

1. **Native Graph Processing**: Optimized for traversing relationships
2. **Index-free Adjacency**: Each node maintains direct references to its neighbors
3. **Query Performance**: Query time is proportional to the searched subgraph, not the total graph size

### Storage Architecture

Neo4j's storage system is organized into specialized store files:

#### Node Storage
- Fixed-size records for fast lookups
- Structure (15 bytes per record):
  - In-use flag (1 byte)
  - Relationship pointer (4 bytes)
  - Property pointer (4 bytes)
  - Label pointer (5 bytes)
  - Flags (1 byte)

#### Relationship Storage
- Fixed-size records containing:
  - Start and end node references
  - Relationship type pointer
  - Next/previous relationship pointers for both nodes
  - Chain position flags

This can be thought of as maintaing two separate doubly linked lists for each relationship. 
To traverse you start with a node which contains the reference to its first relationship. 

### Database Properties

- **Caching**: Uses LRU-K page cache
- **Storage**: Divides store files into discrete regions
- **Page Management**: Fixed number of regions per store file
- **Eviction Policy**: Least frequently used with page popularity consideration

## Working with Neo4j

### API Layers

Neo4j provides multiple ways to interact with the database:

1. **Cypher**: Declarative query language for graph operations
2. **Kernel API**: Low-level access to database transactions
3. **Core API**: Imperative Java API for direct graph manipulation
4. **Traversal Framework**: Declarative Java API for graph traversal

### Code Example: Movie Database

```cypher
// Create movie nodes
CREATE (inception:Movie {
    title: "Inception",
    released: 2010,
    tagline: "Your mind is the scene of the crime"
});

// Create person nodes
CREATE (leonardo:Person {
    name: "Leonardo DiCaprio",
    born: 1974
});

// Create relationships
MATCH (leonardo:Person {name: "Leonardo DiCaprio"})
MATCH (inception:Movie {title: "Inception"})
CREATE (leonardo)-[:ACTED_IN {roles: ["Cobb"]}]->(inception);

// Query directors and their movies
MATCH (director:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(movie:Movie)
RETURN director.name, movie.title;
```

## Future Exploration Areas

1. **Knowledge Graphs**: Neo4j's application in AI and knowledge representation
2. **Facebook's TAO**: Understanding large-scale graph storage systems
3. **Core Database Concepts**:
   - Transaction management and ACID properties
   - Write-ahead logging (WAL)
   - Lock management
   - Replication and availability strategies
